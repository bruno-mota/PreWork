Iâ€™ve been sick with a cold for the past few days, I havenâ€™t been able to start the ToDo App. Could I get an extension for the due date? Or is it doable in a day?
Kush(TF) â€” 09/10/2022
Itâ€™s doable in a day but the deadline is Wednesday midnight

Android studio has my laptop sounding like a rocket ship
Steve â€” Today at 11:23 AM
if you're using the emulator yeah it will do that lol
MassimoChen â€” Today at 11:23 AM
Sameâ€¦it takes also so much time to load up
Leandro Paulino â€” Today at 11:24 AM
I donâ€™t mind. I was surprised cause I exceed the recommended specs for the IDE and emulator
Kinda figured it wouldnâ€™t be so loud ðŸ˜‚
Steve â€” Today at 11:24 AM
It's pretty resource intensive ðŸ˜‚
like way more than Xcode imo
Leandro Paulino â€” Today at 11:25 AM
If there was an iOS dev class Iâ€™d take it too
But I know Android is super popular outside of USA
Steve â€” Today at 11:25 AM
